                <p>Focus would be on the basic infrastructure tasks and items on the critical path to allowing sellers to
				integrate and use Verify Payments in their stores. Without sellers offering Verify Payments, buyers
				will not be able to use it. This would include deploying v0.1 of the Verify Reputation protocol with
				the smart contract methods required to receive transactions and process reputation data at the
				protocol layer. For Verify Payments, implement and deploy the improved checkout experience and
				integrations with popular online store platforms to reduce entry barriers for sellers. It would also
				include design and implementation of the sellersâ€™ credit ceiling algorithm.</p>

USERS (OVER CREDIT CARDS, PAYPAL, ETC.)</h4>

            <div class="timeline-body">
                <p>Having validated the seller-side of the business, focus now shifts from sellers to buyers. The goal is
to improve the checkout experience with a focus on establishing expectations, highlighting buyer
protection features and usability. Dispute resolution features are also built out, including a dashboard
to facilitate interaction between buyers, sellers and the dispute resolution team. Verify Pay-
verify.as 36
ments should become the default payment method for all cryptocurrency users (those with an
existing cryptocurrency wallet).</p>

                <p>By this point, we have already captured a significant share of the cryptocurrency market in terms
				of both buyers and sellers. The goal becomes to convert users that have never used cryptocurrencies
				to Verify Payments users. We provide a strong value proposition to such users over existing
				payment methods, so focus shifts to integration with 3rd party providers like exchanges and wallets
				that simplify the process of purchasing cryptocurrencies using fiat (and then using them on Verify
				Payments). Our goal at this point is to grow the total addressable market by growing the cryptocurrency
				ecosystem.</p>

                <p>With a battle-tested protocol and a healthy Verify Payments business, the Verify reputation platform
				takes center-stage with the goal to enable 3rd party applications to directly integrate with the
				Verify reputation platform and support other novel use-cases (e.g. loans, micropayments, etc.). This
				requires the development of OAuth (or equivalent standard) interfaces and easy-to-use API documentation
				and developer tools for 3rd party application developers.</p>
